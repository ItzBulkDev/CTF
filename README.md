# Capture the Flag
This is the plugin that EPICMC uses on their in-game servers. As of right now this plugin functions, but admittedly it's a little rough around the edges and still has some work that needs to be done.

Feel free to contribute via a pull request! Here is our TODO (https://github.com/EPICMC/CTF/issues/1)

You are allowed to use this plugin on your own servers, but you aren't allowed to take credit for it's development or otherwise commercialize our plugin.

This plugin is currently live on play.epicmc.us (ports: 19133, 19134, 19135, 19136, & 19137)
